## To Do
- Time and cost analysis
    - ~800 USD for tournaments
    - vans --> same cost as men's nats x 3
    - fields is to be seen
    - airbnb --> similar cost to motels, maybe less
    - jerseys --> can use same jerseys, may need lights for nationals
- Talk to Hoodie/Swan about it
    - could be useful to do this first
- Talk to Ryan about facility booking process
- Gauge interest: pitch it to the A team, draw guys from B team if needed
- register teams, tournaments, finalize roster
- sponsorships?
